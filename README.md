# Sample RESTful API v1.0
This is a simple API that includes a datadump of a million records. The API has several endpoints that allow access to data by using various Request Methods(GET, POST, PUSH, DELETE). 
A live working version of this API can be found at [http://www.nivrama.com/api](http://www.nivrama.com/api). 

Please follow the installation Instructions Below to get this API up and running.


Go to [http://docs.vimeochallengeapi.apiary.io](http://docs.vimeochallengeapi.apiary.io) and read documentation on the available endpoints.  You can also test the API with a mock server. I also used POSTMAN to test the apiâ€™s locally
